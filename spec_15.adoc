== Introduction

In the traditional resource management model, a monolithic resource
manager runs with the credentials of a privileged user, typically using
long-running daemons with elevated privileges on compute resources. These
daemons allow the resource manager to complete necessary privileged
work, such as modification of containers, system preparation (such as
prolog/epilog scripts), and most importantly allow the transition of
credentials to that of the requesting user, so that jobs may be successfully
executed in a multi-user environment.

Drawbacks to this monolithic approach include:

 * Total amount of code running with privilege is increased above what
   is strictly necessary
 * Testing of privileged code is more difficult
 * Security patches and updates require a new release of entire project

In the Flux model, however, an instance runs at most with the credentials
of the _instance owner_, including all processes running on computational
resources of the instance. This design works well for single-user instances
of Flux, but multi-user capable instances require some mechanism to perform
privileged operations, most notably when executing work on behalf of a
non instance owner (a guest).

In the Flux system, this privilege - along with all related operations - is
contained within a single service, the _Independent Minister of Privilege_
(IMP), which is responsible for allowing instance owners to run work on
behalf of a guest when the guest user has authorized the instance to do so.

By placing all code running with elevated privilege into a single service,
the following benefits are realized:

 * Code running under privilege is reduced to the logical minimum
 * The privileged service can be tested separately from other Flux components
 * The privileged software release cycle is decoupled from core
   Flux code, allowing updates to be applied out of band.
 * The privileged service is completely under sysadmin control, while
   still allowing users to run test or private versions of Flux even
   in multi-user mode.
 * More fine grained administrative control of privilege. For example,
   simple filesystem access controls may be used to limit which
   users are allowed to run multi-user without preventing these users
   from launching Flux instances altogether.
 * Arbitrary users can run multi-user instances of Flux, thus allowing
   users to share their jobs 

=== User Roles

For the purposes of this RFC there are three main user roles:

 owner, instance owner, or resource owner
  The user under which a Flux instance is running, not privileged.
  This user is considered the owner of all resources to which the Flux
  instance is running.

 system owner
  The user under which the system instance of Flux is running.
  The default owner of all resources on the system.

 guest user, or guest
  A user wishing to use services or run work in a Flux instance when
  they are not the instance owner.

 superuser, or root
  A user with access to perform required privileged operations during
  multi-user execution, such as gaining credentials of other users,
  system setup or initialization, container manipulation, etc. Typically
  the root user.

=== Implementation Requirements

The Flux Security IMP SHALL be implemented with the following overall
design

 * The IMP SHALL be an independent Flux Framework project, with the ability
   to be tested standalone
 * The IMP SHALL be implemented as an executable, `flux-security-imp`,
   which MAY be installed with setuid permissions in cases where multi-user
   Flux is required.
 * The IMP executable SHALL use privilege separation to allow processing
   of user provided data such as command line options and stdin in an
   unprivileged process.
 * The IMP SHALL accept and process data using stdin, to avoid putting
   sensitive data on the command line or environment.

Implementation of the IMP as a separately installed, setuid executable
allows sysadmin control over where and how the IMP is enabled. If the
`flux-security-imp` executable is not installed, or installed without
setuid bits enabled, then multi-user Flux is simply not available, though
single user instances of Flux will still operate. The file permissions,
access controls, or SELinux policy of `flux-security-imp` may also be
manipulated to restrict access to a user or group of users. For instance,
a site may configure permissions such that only a `flux` user has execute
permissions, thus allowing a multi-user system instance running as `flux`,
but disallowing sub-instance jobs access to multi-user capabilities.

=== Overall Design

The operation of the Flux Security IMP is based on the use of structured
request tokens by both the instance owner with control of some resources
and a guest user requesting use of those resources. Each of these tokens
have a guarantee of data integrity and authenticity, such that these requests
cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetectable manner, and the
identity of the creators may be absolutely verified.

When a guest makes a request for a job to a multi-user instance of
Flux, the guest will create a message with information such as the job
specification, a time-to-live, and authorized resource owner, and then
uses IMP client API to sign all fields of the message. The signed message
becomes the user request token *_J_* which authorizes the resource owner to
execute the request at some point on behalf of the guest.

This signed request then becomes part of the user's job.  When the job is
scheduled by the instance, the owner assigns a resource set to the job,
and signs that data _including_ the user's original request. The resource
owner's signature and the assigned resources, in addition to an additional
time-to-live, become a job request token *_R_* which authorizes the guest
user access to the specific resources in the resource set.

This final signed job request token *_R_* becomes the input to the
Flux IMP executable. This allows the IMP to verify that the
resource owner has granted certain resources to a guest user, and that
the guest has authorized the resource owner to execute specific work on
their behalf.

The IMP verifies the integrity and authenticity of both *_R_* and *_J_*
using cryptographic methods provided by plugins.  Once the verification
step is complete, the privileged IMP will invoke system configured
plugins for setup and containment, then change credentials to the
guest user, and finally execute the processes of the job as specified
in *_J_*.

In most cases, the IMP will execute a _job shell_ on behalf of the user,
passing the verfied *_J_* as input to the shell. The shell itself is
provided either by the user or by system configuration, but should not be
provided or modified by the instance owner. The shell re-verifies
integrity and authenticity of *_J_* before proceeding, then interprets
the jobspec contained in *_J_* to determine the set of tasks to invoke
on the current resource set.

[NOTE]
It may be noted that the user's request *_J_* is verified twice when a job
shell is invoked, and this is by design. The IMP verifes *_J_* to avoid
passing tainted input to the job shell, which runs as the guest user.
The shell re-verifies *_J_* because it has no guarantee that the caller
has already done this verification, or that *_J_* has not been changed
since any past verification.

Flux instance.

== Job Request

The proposed contents of the owner's Job Request (*_R_*) as follows

 * User Request (*_J_*) (described below)
 * Assigned resource set
 * Timestamp and TTL
 * UUID
 * Owner Signature (of above fields)

Where *_J_* is the User Request or reference to such a request,
which SHALL contain

 * Jobspec as per link:spec_14{outfilesuffix}[14/Canonical Job Specification]
 * UUID
 * Timestamp and TTL
 * Intended recipient (instance owner)
 * Allowed resource set
 * User signature (of above fields)

Where above fields have the following specific meanings and requirements

 * _Assigned resource set_ is the list of resources assigned to this
   job by the resource owner
 * _Timestamp and TTL_ signifies that the request in question SHALL
   only be valid between _Timestamp_ and _Timestamp+TTL_. This puts a
   time horizon on request usage
 * _UUID_ is a globally unique identifier
 * _Intended recipient_ is set to the instance owner that is the target
   of the request. This ensures that the user's request cannot be
   used by another arbitrary user.
 * The _user signature_ signs all fields of *_J_*
 * The _owner signature_ signs all fields of *_R_* _including_ *_J_*


== IMP Internal Operation

=== Privilege Separation

When the `flux-security-imp` is invoked _and_ has setuid permissions, it
SHALL first perform privilege separation. An underprivileged child is
invoked _as the instance owner_, and this temporary child handles
processing any input, including but not limited to

 * arguments
 * environment
 * processing of marshaled job request *_R_* on stdin
 * connecting to instance to obtain any missing data or data
   referenced by content hash

The underprivileged child then SHALL sanitize and canonicalize the
job request *_R_* into *_R'_*, and SHALL share the canonicalized signed
*_R'_* in a safe export of data to the privileged IMP parent.

Instance and IMP interactions SHALL be implemented as a plugin or set
of plugins, to be provided by the instance owner. These plugins are
required to allow input processing and data gathering to be tailored to
the version of Flux the instance owner is running, which may be custom.
Since these plugins are owner-provided, they MUST NOT be used for data
integrity verification, or in any way modify the user request *_J_*. The
plugins MAY be used to obtain data later used in verification, or otherwise
interact with the instance.

=== Request Verification

Once the privileged IMP process has obtained the canonicalized Job
Request *_R'_*, it SHALL perform the following verification steps:

 1. Verify integrity and authenticity of *_R'_*
 2. Verify owner has access to assigned resource set
 3. Verify integrity and authenticity of *_J_*
 4. Verify TTL on *_R'_* and *_J_*
 5. Verify recipient field in *_J_* matches resource owner
 6. Verify, if included, that assigned resource set is a strict subset
    of the allowed resource set

==== Resource ownership verification

Resources in Flux are initially owned by the _system owner_, i.e. the
user which runs the system instance. Typically, this would be some
special system user, e.g. `flux`. The system owner is the only trusted
user and resource ownership of requests from this user SHALL NOT require
verification.

In order to verify resource ownership for non-system users, the
following requirements should be met:

 * The IMP SHALL support some sort of containment strategy, implemented
   via plugins for maximum flexibility.
 * The IMP's container mechanism MUST support, at a minimum, process
   tracking functionality capable of creating inescapable process groups.
 * The IMP's container strategy MUST be hierarchical, such that containers
   for jobs within an instance are created as sub-containers of
   container of the parent.
 * The IMP SHALL keep an original copy of the request *_R_* as ancillary
   data for each container.

With the following requirements met, the IMP may verify resource
ownership by ensuring that the current container includes the
resources in the assigned resource set, and that the invoking user
is owner of the current container.

==== Revoking resource ownership

Resource ownership MUST be revokable. The result of a revocation SHALL
include termination of all processes currently running in the container
associated with the revoked resource grant. A revocation is recursive,
and removes the container and all child containers, including ancillary
data.

=== IMP post-verification execution

After *_R'_* verification is complete, the `flux-security-imp`
invokes required job setup code as the superuser. This setup code SHALL
be implemented as system-installed and verified plugins, and MAY include
such things as

 * Execution of some sort of job prolog
 * modification of system settings
 * creation of directories
 * state cleanup

Once privileged setup is complete, the security IMP SHALL generate a log
message or other audit trail for the individual request.  Then IMP then
SHALL proceed to obtain credentials of the guest user and finally exec(2)
the work as encoded in the signed user request. After the call to exec(2)
the security IMP is replaced by the guest user processes.

=== Other IMP operational requirements

A multi-user instance of Flux not only requires the ability to execute
work as a guest user, but it must also have privilege to monitor and
kill these processes as part of normal resource manager operation.

==== Signaling and terminating jobs in a multi-user instance

For terminating and signaling processes the IMP SHALL include a `kill`
subcommand which, using the process tracking functionality, SHALL allow
an instance owner to signal or terminate any guest processes including
ancestors thereof that were started by the owner's instance.

=== Credential Format

TBD

=== IMP Plugin Interface

TBD


=== IMP configuration

On execution, the `flux-security-imp` SHALL read a site configuration
file which MAY contain site-specific information such as paths to trusted
executables, plugin locations, certificate authority information etc.
The IMP SHALL check for correct permissions on all configuration
files to reduce the risk of tampering.

=== Specific Defenses

This section describes some attacks and their specific defenses. It
is still a work in progress.

 * _Executing arbitrary process as another user_: The entirety of a user
   job request, including executables, arguments, working directory,
   environment variables, etc, has an integrity guarantee, therefore
   a request cannot be forged, even by the instance owner.

 * _Replay attacks_, where a user's job request is run again without their
   express permission, or a request is taken to another system and executed
   without authority. The _intended recipient_ field of the user request
   protects against users other than the instance owner using the
   guest request, and a fixed time-to-live prevents the request from
   being used indefinitely. Finally, the `flux-security-imp` logs all
   invocations, thereby allowing replays to be detected and audited.
